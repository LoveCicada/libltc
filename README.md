------

Linear (or Longitudinal) Timecode (LTC) is an encoding of SMPTE timecode data
as a Manchester-Biphase encoded audio signal.  
The audio signal is commonly recorded on a VTR track or other storage media.

libltc provides functionality to encode and decode LTC audio from/to 
SMPTE timecode, including SMPTE date support. 

libltc is the successor of [libltcsmpte](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ltcsmpte/).
