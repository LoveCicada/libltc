@mainpage LTC Library

@section intro Introduction

 Linear (or Longitudinal) Timecode (LTC) is an encoding of 
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE_timecode">SMPTE timecode</a> data
 as a 
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Code">Manchester-Biphase</a> 
 encoded audio signal.
 The audio signal is commonly recorded on a VTR track or other storage media.

 libltc provides functionality to encode and decode LTC from/to 
 SMPTE timecode, including SMPTE date support.

</ul>

@section installation Installation
  libltc uses GNU autotools and libtool. The default auto-* workflow applies:

 run <tt>./configure</tt> and build libltc with <tt>make</tt>. See the INSTALL file for further instructions.

 The tar.gz package release includes the build-environment (<tt>configure</tt> script, etc), but if you get the source from the repository, you first need to generate the build environment with something alike:
 <tt>aclocal; autoheader; libtoolize --copy; autoconf; automake --gnu --add-missing --copy</tt>. (<i>OSX users use <tt>glibtoolize</tt></i>). 

 If <a href="http://doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a> is available, the documentation can be [re-]generated from the source by calling <tt>make dox</tt>. Self-test scenarios and example code can be compiled and executed with <tt>make check</tt>.

@section about About
 libltc is the successor of libltcsmpte.

 **Q**: What is the difference between libltcsmpte and libltc?

 **A**: Functionally, there is little difference, usage and work-flow are very similar, too.
    The API has changed almost completely, yet the majority of these changes are 
		only parameter and function names.

		libltc introduces support for encoding vari-speed LTC and drops support
		for operations on SMPTE timecode such as converting
		video-timecode to real-time (seconds, audio-frames).

		Some of the related inappropriate functionality of libltcsmpte was dropped as well,
		e.g. detect timecode discontinuities in decoded LTC/SMPTE.

		libltc works with LTC-frames. It is ignorant about SMPTE semantics and should
		require knowledge or make assumptions about SMPTE of the end-user application.

		In general: the API was simplified and cleaned up.


 **Q**: Why not continue to develop libltcsmpte?

 **A**: Mostly because of API and ABI compatibility issues. libltcsmpte was one of the first
    libraries that I have written. It includes a lot of mistakes: Naming conventions 
		(functions, structure and variables) were chosen unwisely and may cause conflists.
		Merging LTC date-support and making it compile-time optional was the next mistake.
		Versions compiled with-date do not offer to use the user-bits of the LTC frame for
		anything else that date. Even worse is the compile-time option to set the sample-data
		encoding (signed/unsigned, 8/16bit or 32bit float). This made the ABI incompatible
		between versions compiled with different variants.


 **Q**: But you could still have called it libltcsmpte-2.0.0..

 **A**: yes. I could have done that.


@section usage Usage
 Consult \ref ltc.h for a detailed reference of available functions.
 The documentation is also available as Unix manual pages.

 The self-test code lends itself as good examples on how to get started.
 See <tt>tests/decoder.c</tt> and <tt>tests/encoder.c</tt> .
