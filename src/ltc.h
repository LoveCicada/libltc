/**
 * Raw 80 bit SMPTE frame
 *
 * The datastream for each video frame of Longitudinal TimeCode consists of eighty bit-periods.
 *
 * At a frame-rate of 30 fps, the bit-rate corresponds to 30 [fps] * 80 [bits/f] = 2400 bits per second.
 * The frequency for a stream of zeros would be 1.2 kHz and for a stream of ones it would be 2.4 kHz.
 * \image html smptefmt.png
 * With all commonly used video-frame-rates and audio-sample-rates,  LTC timecode can be recorded
 * easily into a audio-track.
 *
 * In each frame, 26 of the eighty bits carry the SMPTE time in binary coded decimal (BCD).
 *
 * These Bits are FRAME-UNITS, FRAME-TENS, SECS-UNITS, SECS-TENS, MINS-UNITS, MINS-TENS, HOURS-UNITS and HOURS-TENS.
 * The BCD digits are loaded 'least significant bit first' (libltc takes care of the architecture specific alignment).
 *
 * 32 bits are assigned as eight groups of four USER-BITS (also sometimes called the "Binary Groups").
 * This capacity is generally used to carry extra info such as reel number and/or date.
 * The User Bits may be allocated howsoever one wishes as long as both Binary Group Flag Bits are cleared.
 *
 * The last 16 Bits make up the SYNC WORD. These bits indicate the frame boundary, the tape direction, and the bit-rate of the sync tone.
 * The values of these Bits are fixed as 0011 1111 1111 1101
 *
 * The Bi-Phase Mark Phase Correction Bit (Bit 27) may be set or cleared so that that every 80-bit word contains an even number of zeroes.
 * This means that the phase of the pulse train in every Sync Word will be the same.
 *
 * Bit 10 indicates drop-frame timecode.
 * The Colour Frame Flag col.frm is Bit 11; if the timecode intentionally synchronized to a colour TV field sequence, this bit is set.
 *
 * Bit 58 is not required for the BCD count for HOURS-TENS (which has a maximum value of two)
 * and has not been given any other special purpose so remains unassigned.
 * This Bit has been RESERVED for future assignment.
 *
 * Bits 43 and 59 are assigned as the Binary Group Flag Bits.
 * These Bits are used to indicate when a standard character set is used to format the User Bits data.
 * The Binary Group Flag Bits should be used only as shown in the truth table below.
 * The Unassigned entries in the table should not be used, as they may be allocated specific meanings in the future.
 *
 * <pre>
 *                                  Bit 43  Bit 59
 *  No User Bits format specified     0       0
 *  Eight-bit character set           1       0
 *  Unassigned (Reserved)             0       1
